# SafeBeat-Infant-Monitor
 This embedded software project utilizes CCS Theia and the TI CC2651P3 MCU to develop an advanced monitoring system that tracks and analyzes ECG (electrocardiogram) and respiratory data in infants, with the goal of preventing infant sleep apnea.

# CCS Theia
In order to build and load the software onto the CC2651P3 MCU, the CCTUDIO-THEIA IDE was used for this project.

The download link for the IDE can be found on TI's website at the link below. Once CCS Theia is installed, the project can be added to the active workspace.
